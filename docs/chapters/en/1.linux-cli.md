### Bash keywords

| -    | -    | -      | -      | -        | -    |
| ---- | ---- | ------ | ------ | -------- | ---- |
| if   | then | elif   | else   | fi       | time |
| for  | in   | until  | while  | do       | done |

### Expression

- How to evaluate an expression:

  - `test` expression
  - [[expression]]

- Operator:

  - &&: run next command if the previous is successful

Example:

```shell
test -d "$directory" && cd "$directory"
```

- ||: run next command if the previous is failed

Example:

```shell
cd "$directory" && echo "Success" || echo "Failed"
```

### Control stdout in Linux

List:

- `command > output.txt`

The standard output stream will be redirected to the file only, it will not be visible in the terminal. If the file already exists, it gets overwritten.

- `command >> output.txt`

The standard output stream will be redirected to the file only, it will not be visible in the terminal. If the file already exists, the new data will get appended to the end of the file.

---

- `command 2> output.txt`

The standard error stream will be redirected to the file only, it will not be visible in the terminal. If the file already exists, it gets overwritten.

- `command 2>> output.txt`

The standard error stream will be redirected to the file only, it will not be visible in the terminal. If the file already exists, the new data will get appended to the end of the file.

---

- `command &> output.txt`

Both the standard output and standard error stream will be redirected to the file only, nothing will be visible in the terminal. If the file already exists, it gets overwritten.

- `command &>> output.txt`

Both the standard output and standard error stream will be redirected to the file only, nothing will be visible in the terminal. If the file already exists, the new data will get appended to the end of the file..

---

- `command | tee output.txt`

The standard output stream will be copied to the file, it will still be visible in the terminal. If the file already exists, it gets overwritten.

- `command | tee -a output.txt`

The standard output stream will be copied to the file, it will still be visible in the terminal. If the file already exists, the new data will get appended to the end of the file.

---

- `(*)`

Bash has no shorthand syntax that allows piping only StdErr to a second command, which would be needed here in combination with tee again to complete the table. If you really need something like that, please look at "How to pipe stderr, and not stdout?" on Stack Overflow for some ways how this can be done e.g. by swapping streams or using process substitution.

---

- `command |& tee output.txt`

Both the standard output and standard error streams will be copied to the file while still being visible in the terminal. If the file already exists, it gets overwritten.

- `command |& tee -a output.txt`

Both the standard output and standard error streams will be copied to the file while still being visible in the terminal. If the file already exists, the new data will get appended to the end of the file.

### STD in/out conventionals

- `> /dev/null` throw away _stdout_
- `1> /dev/null` throw away _stdout_
- `2> /dev/null` throw away _stderr_
- `&> /dev/null` throw away _stdout_ and _stderr_

### Loop

Read a file line by line assigning the value to a variable:

```shell
while read -r line; do
    echo "Text read from file: $line"
done < my_filename.txt
```

Loop string in array:

```shell
array=("string1" "string2")
for string in ${array[@]}; do
    echo $string
done
```

> with array index

```shell
allThreads=("string1" "string2")
for i in ${!allThreads[@]}; do
  echo ${allThreads[$i]}
done
```

### Handy snippets

- Read a file line by line assigning the value to a variable

```shell
while read -r line; do
    echo "Text read from file: $line"
done < my_filename.txt
```

---

- Simple multiple files/folders maker

```shell
mkdir -p project/{app,frontend,backend}
touch {main,variables,provider}.tf
```

---

- Loop in a string array

```shell
b=("aa" "ab"); for t in ${b[@]} ; do echo $t ; done
echo ${#b[@]} # get array length
```

---

- Run multiple replicated command with multiple files

```shell
for a in *.yml; ansible-playbook "$a" --syntax-check ; done
```

---

- Do multiple silent task

```shell
for file in $(find /home/ec2-user/ -type f); do cmd1 $file | cmd2 &disown ; done
```

```shell
command > file.log 2>&1 &
```

---

- Backgroud process to file (stdout + stderr)

```shell
command > file.log 2>&1 &
```

Explanation:

- `>` stdout to file
- `2>&1`: redirect stderr to stdout
- `&`: run process in backgroud

---

- Update multiple files' name in 1 command

```shell
find . -name "*_f"| sed "s/.\///g" | while read f ; do mv "$f" "${f%?????}_f"; done
```

- Manage IP tables

```shell
iptables -P INPUT ACCEPT
iptables -I INPUT 1 -p tcp -s 159.89.202.45 -j ACCEPT
iptables -P FORWARD ACCEPT
iptables -P OUTPUT ACCEPT
iptables -P INPUT DROP
```

---

- `telnet`

- Without interaction

```shell
echo -e '\x1dclose\x0d' | telnet {$IP_ADDRESS} {$PORT}
```

- Multiple IPs with SSH port

```shell
PORT=22 list=("172.29.211.1" "172.29.211.2") ; for ip in "${list[@]}" ; do echo -e '\x1dclose\x0d' | timeout 2 telnet $ip {$PORT} && echo "connect $ip success" || echo "connect $ip failed" ; done
```

---

- `sed` common use cases

- Replace string directly on file

```shell
sed -i 's/pattern1/pattern2/g' filename
```

---

- Concatenate file common use cases

- Insert multiple-lines text in to new file

```shell
cat <<EOF > filename
Multiple
Lines
Text
Data
EOF
```

- Appending multiple-lines text in to existed file

```shell
cat <<EOF >> filename
Multiple
Lines
Text
Data
EOF
```

- Append text with sudoers (persistent mount point)

```shell
echo -e "\nnfs-uuid:/  /mnt/efs nfs4 nfsvers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,hard,timeo=600,retrans=2,noresvport,_netdev 0 0" | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
```

- Append content to file with sudo privileges

- Create multiple-lines text file as sudoer

```shell
sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/custom-service.service > /dev/null <<-EOF
# *****************************************************************
# *********************** Custom Service **************************
# *****************************************************************

[Unit]
Description=Custom Service
After=network.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/start/script/for/custom-service
ExecStop=/stop/script/for/custom-service
User=root

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
EOF
```

- Create json file with variable in bash

```shell
SAMPLE='
{
    "Comment": "Update DNSName.",
    "Changes": [
        {
            "Action": "UPSERT",
            "ResourceRecordSet": {
                "Name": "alex.",
                "Type": "A",
                "AliasTarget": {
                    "HostedZoneId": "-##",
                    "DNSName": "$bar",
                    "EvaluateTargetHealth": false
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
'
echo "${SAMPLE}" | tee output-file-path.json > /dev/null
```

- Trim 2 last string

```shell
new_string=${string%??}
```

- Convert string to array

```shell
IFS=" " read -a array <<< "1 2 3 4"
```

```shell
array=($(echo "one,two,three" | tr ',' '\n'))
```
